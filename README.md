Demo for HTML and CSS training

Made a "Create Account" page using a reference provided by Kalashree. This demo is used to show what I learned in the first two weeks of my training as a Software Developer. The Create Account page features six different text fields to input personal information (i.e. First/Last Name, Password, and Phone Number). Additionally, I provided a date input so that the user can provide their birthday. Last, I added a submission button that reads "Join Now". 

I attempted to style the Create Account page as a DCKAP developer would by adding a color palette that is reminiscent of the the DCKAP colors. Additionally, I attempted to create a modern-looking page by making it responsive to the best of my abilities.
